## Getting started 

1. Load packages. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

2. Load data from the `.rds` file you created in Exercise 2. Have a guess at what the function is called. 

```{r}
diabetes_glucose <- read_rds('../out/diabetes_glucose.rds')
head(diabetes_glucose)
```

## Plotting - Part 1
You will first do some basic plots to get started with ggplot again. 

If it has been a while since you worked with ggplot, have a look at the [ggplot material](https://center-for-health-data-science.github.io/FromExceltoR/Presentations/presentation3.html) from the FromExceltoR course.

3. Create a scatter plot of `Age` and `Blood Pressure`. Do you notice a trend?

```{r}
diabetes_glucose %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = BloodPressure, 
             y = Age)) + 
  geom_point() 
```

4. Create a scatter plot of `PhysicalActivity` and `BMI.` Do you notice a trend?
```{r}
diabetes_glucose %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = PhysicalActivity, 
             y = BMI)) + 
  geom_point() 
```

5. Now, create the same two plots as before, but this time stratify them by `Diabetes`. Do you notice any trends?

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Hint

You can stratify a plot by a categorical variable in several ways, depending on the type of plot. The purpose of stratification is to distinguish samples based on their categorical values, making patterns or differences easier to identify. This can be done using aesthetics like `color`, `fill`, `shape`. 

:::

```{r}
diabetes_glucose %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = BloodPressure, 
             y = Age, 
             color = Diabetes)) + 
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
diabetes_glucose %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = PhysicalActivity, 
             y = BMI, 
             color = Diabetes)) + 
  geom_point() 
```

6. Create a boxplot of `BMI` stratified by `Diabetes.` Give the plot a meaningful title.
```{r}
diabetes_glucose %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = BMI, 
             x = Diabetes, 
             color = Diabetes)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(title = 'Distribution of BMI Stratified by Diabetes')
```

7. Create a boxplot of `PhysicalActivity` stratified by `Smoker`. Give the plot a meaningful title.
```{r}
diabetes_glucose %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = PhysicalActivity, 
             x = Smoker, 
             fill = Smoker)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(title = 'Distribution of Physical Activity Stratified by Smoker Status')
```



## Plotting - Part 2
In order to plot the data inside the nested variable, the data needs to be unnested. 

8. Create a boxplot of the glucose measurements at time 0 stratified by `Diabetes`. Give the plot a meaningful title.

```{r}
diabetes_glucose %>%
  unnest(OGTT) %>% 
  filter(Measurement == 0) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = `Glucose (mmol/L)`, 
             x = Diabetes, 
             color = Diabetes)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(title = 'Glucose Measurement for Time Point 0 (fasted)')
```

9. Create these boxplots for each time point (0, 60, 120) by using faceting by `Measurement`. Give the plot a meaningful title.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Hint
Faceting allows you to create multiple plots based on the values of a categorical variable, making it easier to compare patterns across groups. In ggplot2, you can use `facet_wrap` for a single variable or `facet_grid` for multiple variables.

:::

```{r}
diabetes_glucose %>%
  unnest(OGTT) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = `Glucose (mmol/L)`, 
             x = Diabetes, 
             color = Diabetes)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  facet_wrap(vars(Measurement)) + 
  labs(title = 'Glucose Measurements for Time Point 0, 60, and 120')
```

10. Calculate the mean glucose levels for each time point. 

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Hint
You will need to use `unnest()`, `group_by()`, and `summerise()`.

:::

```{r}
diabetes_glucose %>%
  unnest(OGTT) %>% 
  group_by(Measurement) %>% 
  summarise(`Glucose (mmol/L)` = mean(`Glucose (mmol/L)`))
```


11. Make the same calculation as above, but additionally group the results by `Diabetes`. Save the data frame in a variable. Compare your results to the boxplots you made above. 

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Hint
Group by several variables: `group_by(var1, var2)`.

:::

```{r}
glucose_mean <- diabetes_glucose %>%
  unnest(OGTT) %>% 
  group_by(Measurement, Diabetes) %>%
  summarize(`Glucose (mmol/L)` = mean(`Glucose (mmol/L)`)) %>%
  ungroup()

glucose_mean
```


12. Create a plot that visualizes glucose measurements across time points, with one line for each patient ID. Then color the lines by their diabetes status. In summary, each patient's glucose measurements should be connected with a line, grouped by their ID, and color-coded by `Diabetes`. Give the plot a meaningful title. 

If your time points are strangely ordered have a look at the `levels` of your `Measurement` variable (the one that specifies which time point the measurement was taken at) and if necessary fix their order.

```{r}
diabetes_glucose %>%
  unnest(OGTT) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Measurement,
             y = `Glucose (mmol/L)`)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Diabetes)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = ID, color = Diabetes)) + 
  labs(title = 'Glucose Measurements Across Time Points by Diabetes Status')
```


## Plotting - Part 3: PCA 

For this part we will use this [tutorial](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggfortify/vignettes/plot_pca.html) to make a principal component analysis (PCA). First, we perform some preprocessing to get our data into the right format. 

13. Let's start by unnesting the OGTT data and using pivot wider so that each Glucose measurement time point gets its own column (again). 

```{r}
diabetes_glucose_unnest <-  diabetes_glucose %>% 
  unnest(OGTT) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Measurement, 
              values_from = `Glucose (mmol/L)`, 
              names_prefix = "Glucose_")

diabetes_glucose_unnest
```


14. Have a look at your unnested diabetes data set. Can you use all the variables to perform PCA? Subset the dataset to only include the relevant variables.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Hint
PCA can only be performed on numerical values. Extract these (except ID!) from the dataset. 
Numerical columns can easily be selected with the `where(is.numeric)` helper.
:::


Extract the numerical columns, including the OGTT measurements. 

```{r}
diabetes_glucose_numerical <- diabetes_glucose_unnest %>%
  select(where(is.numeric))

diabetes_glucose_numerical
```


15. PCA cannot handle NA's in the dataset. Remove all rows with NA in any column in your numerical subset. 
Then, go back to the original unnested data `diabetes_glucose_unnest` (or what you have called it) and also here drop rows that have NAs in the numerical columns (so the same rows you dropped from the numeric subset).This is important because we want to use (categorical) columns present in the original data to later color the resulting PCA, so the two dataframes (original and only numeric columns) need to be aligned and contain the same rows.


```{r}
diabetes_glucose_numerical <- drop_na(diabetes_glucose_numerical)
nrow(diabetes_glucose_numerical)
```

Align original data.

```{r}
diabetes_glucose_unnest <- diabetes_glucose_unnest %>%
  drop_na(colnames(diabetes_glucose_numerical))
nrow(diabetes_glucose_unnest)
```

Now our data is ready to make a PCA.

16. Calculate the PCA by running `prcomp` on our prepared data (see the tutorial). Then, create a plot of the resulting PCA (also shown in tutorial).

```{r}
library(ggfortify)

pca_res <- prcomp(diabetes_glucose_numerical, scale. = TRUE)

autoplot(pca_res)
```

17. Color your PCA plot and add loadings. Think about which variable you want to color by. Remember to refer to the dataset that has this variable (probably not your numeric subset!)

```{r}
autoplot(pca_res, data = diabetes_glucose_unnest, colour = 'Diabetes',
         loadings = TRUE, loadings.colour = 'black',
         loadings.label = TRUE, loadings.label.size = 3)
```

18. Add a ggplot `theme` and title to your plot and save it. 


```{r}
autoplot(pca_res, data = diabetes_glucose_unnest, colour = "Diabetes",
         loadings = TRUE, loadings.colour = "grey30", loadings.label.colour = "black",
         loadings.label = TRUE, loadings.label.size = 3.5) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title = "PCA of Diabetes Dataset")

ggsave('../figures/PCA_diabetes.png', width = 7, height = 5)
```

19. Calculate the variance explained by each of the PC's using the following formula:

$$
\text{Variance Explained} = \frac{\text{sdev}^2}{\sum \text{sdev}^2} \times 100
$$

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Hint

You can access the standard deviation from the PCA object like this: `pca_res$sdev`. 

:::

```{r}
variance_explained <- ((pca_res$sdev^2) / sum(pca_res$sdev^2)) * 100
variance_explained
```

20. Create a two column data-frame with the names of the PC's (PC1, PC2, ect) in one column and the variance explained by that PC in the other column. 

```{r}
df_variance_explained <- tibble(PC = c(paste0('PC', 1:length(variance_explained))),
                                variance_explained = variance_explained)

df_variance_explained
```

21. Now create a bar plot (using `geom_col`), showing for each PC the amount of explained variance. This type of plot is called a scree plot.  


```{r}
df_variance_explained %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = PC, 
             y = variance_explained))+ 
  geom_col() + 
  labs(title = "Varinace explained for each PC", 
       y = "Variance Explained")
```

22. Lastly, render you quarto document and review the resulting html file.


-------------------------------

## Extra

e1. Recreate the plot you made in Exercise 12 and include the mean value for each glucose measurement for the two diabetes statuses (0 and 1) you calculated in Exercise 11. This plot should look like this:

![](../out/figure3_13.png){fig-align="center"}


```{r}

diabetes_glucose %>%
  unnest(OGTT) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Measurement,
             y = `Glucose (mmol/L)`)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Diabetes)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = ID, color = Diabetes)) + 
  geom_point(data = glucose_mean, aes(x = Measurement, y = `Glucose (mmol/L)`)) +
  geom_line(data = glucose_mean, aes(x = Measurement, y = `Glucose (mmol/L)`, 
                                     group = Diabetes, linetype = Diabetes)) +
  labs(title = "Glucose Measurements with Mean by Diabetes Status")

ggsave('../out/figure3_13.png')
```
