Here we show the content inside `solution4_functions.R`. Remember, the file containing your outsourced functions needs to be an R script (.R), not a quarto document!

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Include the content of the .R file
file_content <- readLines("./solution4_functions.R")
cat(file_content, sep = "\n")
```
