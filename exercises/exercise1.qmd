## Getting started

1.  Load packages.

2.  Load in the `diabetes_clinical_toy_messy.xlsx` data set.

## Explore the data

Use can you either base R or/and tidyverse to solve the exercises. 

3.  How many missing values (NA's) are there in each column. 

4.  Check the ranges and distribution of each of the variables in the dataset. Remember, the variables might be different types. Do any values seem weird or unexpected?

## Clean up the data

Now that we have had a look at the data, it is time to correct fixable mistakes and remove observations that cannot be corrected.

Consider the following:

-   What should we do with the rows that contain NA's? Do we remove them or keep them?

-   Which odd things in the data can we correct with confidence and which cannot?

-   Are there zeros in the data? Are they true zeros or errors?

-   Do you want to change any of the classes of the variables?

5.  Make a clean version of the dataset according to your considerations.

## Hint
Have a look at `ID`, `BloodPressure`, `BMI`, `Sex`, and `Diabetes`.

## Meta Data

There is some metadata to accompany the dataset you have just cleaned in `diabetes_meta_toy_messy.csv`. This is a csv file, not an excel sheet, so you need to use the `read_delim` function to load it. Load in the dataset and inspect it. 

6.2. Load the meta data set.

6.3. How many missing values (NA's) are there in each column. 

6.4. Check the distribution of each of the variables. Consider that the variables are of different classes. Do any of the distributions seam odd to you?

6. 5. Make a clean version of the dataset according to your considerations.

## Join the datasets

7. Consider which variable the datasets should be joined on.

8. Consider how you want to join the datasets. Do you want to use `full_join`, `inner_join`, `left_join` and `rigth_join`?

The joining variable must be the same type in both datasets.

10. How many rows does the joined dataset have? Explain how the join-function you used resulted in the given number of rows. 

11. Export the joined dataset. Think about which directory you want to save the file in.
