## Getting started

1.  Load packages.

2.  Load in the `diabetes_clinical_toy_messy.xlsx` data set.

## Explore the data

Use can you either base R or/and tidyverse to solve the exercises. 

3.  How many missing values (NA's) are there in each column. 

4.  Check the distribution of each of the variables. Consider that they are of different classes. Do any of the distributions seam odd to you?

## Clean up the data

Now that we have had a look at the data, it is time to correct fixable mistakes and remove observations that cannot be corrected.

Consider the following:

-   What should we do with the rows that contain NAs? Do we remove them or keep them?

-   Which mistakes in the data can be corrected, and which cannot?

-   Are there zeros in the data? Are they true zeros or errors?

-   Do you want to change any of the classes of the variables?

5.  Clean the data according to your considerations.

<div>
  <a href="#hint-section1" class="collapse-toggle" data-bs-toggle="collapse" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="hint-section1" style="text-decoration: none; font-size: 1em;">
    Hint
  </a>
  <div class="collapse" id="hint-section1" style="margin-top: 10px;">
    
  Have a look at `BloodPressure`, `BMI`, `Sex`, and `Diabetes`. 

  </div>
</div>

## Meta Data

6.  Perform step 2-5 from above and do data exploration and cleaning workflow for the `diabetes_meta_toy_messy.xlsx` data set.

## Join the datasets

7. Consider what variable the datasets should be joined on.

<div>
  <a href="#hint-section2" class="collapse-toggle" data-bs-toggle="collapse" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="hint-section2" style="text-decoration: none; font-size: 1em;">
    Hint
  </a>
  <div class="collapse" id="hint-section2" style="margin-top: 10px;">
    
  The joining variable must be the same type in both datasets.

  </div>
</div>

8. Join the datasets by the variable you selected above.

9. How many rows does the joined dataset have? Explain why. 

<div>
  <a href="#hint-section3" class="collapse-toggle" data-bs-toggle="collapse" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="hint-section3" style="text-decoration: none; font-size: 1em;">
    Hint
  </a>
  <div class="collapse" id="hint-section3" style="margin-top: 10px;">
    
  Because we used left_join, only the IDs that are in `diabetes_clinical_clean` are kept. 

  </div>
</div>

10. Export the joined dataset. Think about which directory you want to save the file in.
