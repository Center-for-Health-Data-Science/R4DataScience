## Introduction

In this exercise you will fit and interpret a linear regression model.

### Getting started

1. Load packages

2. Load the data `boston.csv` 

This dataset describes conditions surrounding the Boston housing market in the 1970s. Each row describes a zone in the Boston area (so there is more than one house in each row).

The columns are:

    crim - per capita crime rate
    indus - proportion of non-retail businesses
    nox - Nitrogen oxides concentration (air pollution)
    rm - average number of rooms
    neighborhood - the type of neighborhood the zone is in
    medv - median value per house in 1000s


### Explore the data

3. Does the datatype of each column fit to it what it describes? Do you need to change any data types?


### Making a model

4. Split the dataset into test and training data.

5. Fit a model of how well the number of rooms (`rm`), crime rate (`crim`) and neighborhood type (`neighborhood`) predict the value of the houses (`medv`).

6. Describe what information you get from the model summary. 

7. Scale the numeric predictor columns and redo the modelling. What has changed?

## Hint
There is a scale function, see `?scale()`.
