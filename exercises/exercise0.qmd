## File Management & Data Download

1.  **Make a new directory** for this course.

2.  **Go to course website** and to the Data tab. Press the **Download Data** button.

3.  Move the Data folder to your course directory.

4.  Under your course directory, make a new folder for your scripts, one for our output, and another for the presentations you download.

Your file tree should look something like this:

## Working directories

5.  **Open R studio**.

6.  **Access your current working directory** by writing `getwd()` in the console.

The working directory in R (or other programming environments) is the folder on your computer where R looks for files to read or write by default. When you load or save data, R will use the working directory unless you specify another path. A path can either be **absolute** or **relative**: 

- **Absolute path**: The path from the root of your file system to the input file. 

- **Relative path**: The path from the working directory to the input file.

## R Script

7.  Create an R script and save it in your work folder.

An R script is a plain text file containing a series of R commands and code used for data analysis. R scripts have a `.R` extension and can be executed line-by-line in an interactive R session or as a whole script. They are ideal for automating workflows and keeping your analyses reproducible and organized. R scripts can be submitted to a job on a supercomputer unlike Quarto documents. 

9.  Type `getwd()` in your R script and run the line. Compare the working directory with the one from the console.

10. Change the working directory using `setwd()`.

11. Run `getwd()` again.

12. Type in a few lines of code and some comments and re-save the file.

## Quarto

13. Create an Quarto document and save it in your work folder.

Quarto is an open-source publishing system designed to help you create dynamic, reproducible documents, presentations, and websites. It extends the ideas of tools like R Markdown, combining simplicity with powerful customization options for modern scientific and technical communication.

14. Type `getwd()` in a code chunk in your Quarto document and run the line. Compare the working directory with the one from the console.

15. Change the working directory in one chuck using `setwd()`.

16. Run `getwd()` in the same chunk as `setwd()` AND in another chunk. What do you observe?

## Hint

```{r eval=FALSE}
setwd('')
getwd()
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
getwd()
```

17. Create some code chunks, write text and headers. Re-save the file.

18. Render the Quarto document and have a look at the html file.

## R project

An R project in RStudio creates a self-contained working environment tied to a specific folder, which becomes the default working directory for all scripts, data, and outputs. This structure helps organize files, ensures reproducibility, and simplifies path management.
By default, a Quarto document’s working directory is its file location. While this can be changed chunk-wise, the working directory for R scripts can be set globally for all scripts in a folder by creating an R project. The R project is a small configuration file, usually placed in the root of the project folder, and requires no manual interaction—it quietly ensures your workflows remain well-organized.

19. Create an R project by clicking the *Project (None)* in the top right → *New Project* → *Existing Directory* and choose an appropriate location. Look at the top-right corner to check that you are in your R project. 

20. Reopen the the R script and Quarto document you created in Exercise 7 and 13 respectively. Check each of their working directories. Are they as you expect? Explain. 

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Hint

- The working directory of the R script is the same as the location of the `.Rproj` file. 

- The working directory of the Quarto document is always the same as the location of the document.

21. If you like the flow of the R project, keep it. If not, delete it. It is not necessary to have an R project. **NB** If you delete it, click the R project drop-down menu in the top-right corner → *Close Project*.
