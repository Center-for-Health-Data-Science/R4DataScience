## Center for Health Data Science

In the Center for Health Data Science (HeaDS) we do both research and in the DataLab and Sandbox we develop and host course. Read more about all the cool stuff we do on our [website](https://heads.ku.dk).

### DataLab

The DataLab offers a range of services to support SUND employees in their data science analyses. Here’s an overview:

-   **Courses:** We offer data science and bioinformatics courses for all SUND staff (researchers, administrative staff, technical staff, etc.). Our most popular courses include *"From Excel to R," "Python Tsunami,"* and *"Introduction to Bulk RNA-seq Analysis."*
-   **Consultations:** We host drop-in sessions every Thursday from 13:00 to 15:00, where we assist with data science-related challenges and questions. Alternatively, you can reach out to arrange a one-on-one meeting on another day.
-   **Commissions:** We conduct commissioned research, such as bioinformatics and data science analyses tailored to your needs. Additionally, we offer a commissioned supervision scheme if you would like to learn how to perform the analysis yourself.
-   **Events:** We host various data science events. Join us for our seminar series, *"Talking HeaDS."* Our next session is in the fall (date and speeker TBA). Join **Health Data Science Day** i November: https://eventsignup.ku.dk/hdsd2025.
